SECTION 4 - TONE / STYLE CALIBRATION
=================================================================

<<< START WRITING TONE SAMPLE - DO NOT COPY CONTENT >>>
    [Use these samples only to match tone, pacing, and style. Do not copy subject matter, structure, or concepts.]
    Sample 1
        Great engineering leadership is about understanding people, timing, and the quiet spaces in between.
        I learned this during a long effort to resolve a quality issue that revealed itself only when I stepped back
        and observed the rhythm of the process. That experience shaped how I lead: clarity, discipline, and 
        communication work best when people and systems are understood together. Across my career, I have focused on
        simplifying the complex, aligning teams around stable processes, and guiding work with steady, thoughtful structure.
        My goal is always the same: build the clarity and environment that allow people and operations to perform at
        their best.
    Sample 2
        My approach to leadership comes from hands-on experience with engineering, production, and operations teams.
        I focus on translating complex details into clear steps people can follow with confidence.
        Reliable outcomes come from disciplined processes, thoughtful sequencing, and understanding how teams respond
        to structure. I aim to create environments where technical rigor and practical execution support each other,
        allowing people to perform with clarity and purpose.

SECTION 5 - REFERENCE MATERIALS
=================================================================

<<<START:CS50P_Problem_Instructions>>>
Regular, um, Expressions
It’s not uncommon, in English, at least, to say “um” when trying to, um, think of a word. The more you do it, though, the more noticeable it tends to be!

In a file called um.py, implement a function called count that expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that “um” appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like hello, um, world, the function should return 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function should return 0.

Structure um.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.

import re
import sys


def main():
    print(count(input("Text: ")))


def count(s):
    ...


...


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Either before or after you implement count in um.py, additionally implement, in a file called test_um.py, three or more functions that collectively test your implementation of count thoroughly, each of whose names should begin with test_ so that you can execute your tests with:

pytest test_um.py
Hints
Demo

Before You Begin
Log into cs50.dev, click on your terminal window, and execute cd by itself. You should find that your terminal window’s prompt resembles the below:

$
Next execute

mkdir um
to make a folder called um in your codespace.

Then execute

cd um
to change directories into that folder. You should now see your terminal prompt as um/ $. You can now execute

code um.py
to make a file called um.py where you’ll write your program. Be sure to also execute

code test_um.py
to create a file called test_um.py where you’ll, um, write tests for your program.

How to Test
How to Test um.py
Here’s how to test um.py manually:

Run your program with python um.py. Ensure your program prompts you for an input. Type um, followed by Enter. Your count function should return 1.
Run your program with python um.py. Type um?, followed by Enter. Your count function should return 1.
Run your program with python um.py. Type Um, thanks for the album., followed by Enter. Your count function should return 1.
Run your program with python um.py. Type Um, thanks, um..., followed by Enter. Your count function should return 2.
How to Test test_um.py
To test your tests, run pytest test_um.py. Try to use correct and incorrect versions of um.py to determine how well your tests spot errors:

Ensure you have a correct version of um.py. Run your tests by executing pytest test_um.py. pytest should show that all of your tests have passed.
Modify the count function in the correct version of um.py. count might, for example, mistakently also count any “um” that is part of a word. Run your tests by executing pytest test_um.py. pytest should show that at least one of your tests has failed.
Again modify the count function in the correct version of um.py. count might, for example, mistakenly only match an “um” that is surrounded on either side by a space. Run your tests by executing pytest test_um.py. pytest should show that at least one of your tests has failed.
You can execute the below to check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/um
Green smilies mean your program has passed a test! Red frownies will indicate your program output something unexpected. Visit the URL that check50 outputs to see the input check50 handed to your program, what output it expected, and what output your program actually gave.

How to Submit
In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/um
