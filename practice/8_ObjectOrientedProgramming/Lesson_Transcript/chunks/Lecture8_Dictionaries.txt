18:42
and let's see if we're either making things better or for worse than us. Recall that dictionaries, or dict objects, also exist in Python.
18:49
And a dictionary is this collection of keys and values. And the upside, in particular, of a dictionary
18:55
is that they have better semantics. You don't just have to assume that a name is always going to be at location 0; house is always going to be at location 1.
19:03
That's the kind of thing, especially if you had three, four, or more values-- eventually you or someone is going to get confused and forget
19:10
what the order is and you're going to write buggy code. So a dictionary is a little more powerful
19:15
in that you can semantically associate keys, little descriptions, with the values-- those keys and those values, respectively.
19:22
So let me go ahead and do this, and we can do this in a few different ways. But let me propose that we focus on get_student here .
19:28
And let's go ahead and do this. Let me go ahead and delete the implementation of get_student as is.
19:35
Let me create a student variable and initialize it to an empty dictionary. And I can do that with just two curly braces here.
19:43
And then let me go ahead and set two keys inside of that dictionary. Inside of the student, there will be, quote unquote, a "name"
19:49
key, and the value of that is going to be whatever the return value of input is when I prompt the user for their name.
19:55
And then the "house" key, inside of that same student dictionary, is going to be the return value of whatever the user types
20:02
in for their house. , And lastly I'm going to go ahead and return student. So now I am literally returning one thing, still,
20:11
but this time, it's a dict rather than a tuple, rather than a list. But there are still two things in it, technically four things
20:18
if you count the keys and the values. But there's two key value pairs. Now, my code up here is going to have to change a little bit.
20:24
And let's simplify this and remove, for instance, now the Padma if statement just to focus on what's changing at hand.
20:31
And let me go ahead now and leave line 2 alone. I'm still going to have a student variable that gets assigned the return
20:37
value of get_student. But what I want to do here now is actually access the keys inside of that
20:45
dictionary-- not by numeric index, which was for tuples and lists-- 0 and 1, but by way of the keys.
20:52
Now, normally, I might be in the habit, as I personally am, of using double quotes-- quote, unquote, "name" inside of there
20:58
and quote, unquote, "house" inside of there. But before I even run this code and show you a mistake--
21:05
see an error on the screen, does anyone want to call out what I have done wrong here? This is just an f string.
21:12
I just want to print out the value of the name key, the value of the house key in this dictionary.
21:18
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] DAVID J. MALAN: Your audio was a little garbled for us. But I think I heard double quotes and single quotes.
21:26
So I'm going to assume that, indeed, you've identified precisely the issue. I'm just going to confuse Python right now.
21:31
Even though this is an f string inside of double quotes, prefixed with an f, I can't actually use my double quotes inside my double quotes
21:39
because that's going to potentially confuse Python. If I run this program now, Python of student.py and hit
21:44
Enter, I get a syntax error. So the program didn't even run fully. It just couldn't be understood because it got confused by those double quotes.
21:51
So the simplest fix here would indeed just be to use not double quotes but single quotes around the keys,
21:58
or conversely, flip the double quotes on the outside to single quotes, then use double quotes in the inside.
22:03
You just want to be consistent. So a subtle detail, but again, this is now specific to dictionary syntax.
22:09
This isn't fundamental to how we're solving this current problem at hand.
22:14
Well, let's go ahead and try this. Let me go ahead now and run Python of student.py. Let's go ahead and type in Harry.
22:19
Let's type in Gryffindor. And hopefully, Harry is back from Gryffindor. No syntax errors.
22:25
No other errors. I think I'm back in business here. And what I do like to be clear about using a dictionary
22:31
is that it's allowing me just better semantics. And again, I don't have to remember, memorize, document that 0 is name;
22:38
1 is house. Instead, "name" is name and "house" is house. It's just a little clearer, a little more expressive.
22:45
So that's generally a good thing, especially if we stored more data about students than just their name and their house-- if you had three fields, four,
22:53
five, 10 different fields-- no one's going to want to remember or be able to remember forever which is zero
22:58
which is 1, which is 2, and so forth. Better to introduce names, like "name" and "house" in this case.
23:04
But let me tighten this up further. I'm typically in the habit of not introducing variables unnecessarily,
23:10
unless they make the code more readable. And an alternative way to format the same code would be this.
23:15
Strictly speaking, I don't need to create an empty dictionary, then add one key to it, then add a second key to it,
23:23
and then return that dictionary. I can actually consolidate this all into one statement, if you will.
23:29
Let me go ahead and do this. Let me go ahead and say name equals inputs return value,
23:35
house equals inputs return value, and then, instead of returning any variable name student, which I'm going to propose
23:41
doesn't need to exist anymore, let me just create and return the dictionary all at once. Let me do, quote, unquote, "name" in lowercase here, and then the variable.
23:50
It's storing the user's name. Then, quote, unquote, "house," as my second key, the value of which is going to be house, the variable.
23:57
Now, is this better? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe the first way was a little more readable, and that's totally fine to create variables
24:03
if they improve the readability of your code. But just know that you can also create and return a dictionary on the fly
24:09
like this, so to speak, all in one line, and I think it's arguably pretty reasonable in this case. Why?
24:14
It's just pretty short. I probably wouldn't do this if it got longer and longer and longer. I might minimally then start moving my key value pairs to separate lines.
24:22
But this would just be a slightly more compact way of doing this as well. But let me propose we do one more change.
24:29
Let's go ahead and introduce that same special casing of Padma to fix her house from Gryffindor, for instance, to Ravenclaw.
24:36
How do we do this with dictionaries? Well, dictionaries, like lists, are mutable.
24:41
You can change what is in them, just like you can lists. How do you do that? It's just a little different syntactically.
24:48
So let's go back into main and do this fix. If the student variable has a name key that equals equals Padma, then,
24:57
indented, go ahead and change the value of the house key inside of that student
25:04
dictionary to be, quote, unquote, "Ravenclaw" instead. So very similar in spirit to what we did with a list.
25:11
But instead of using location 0 and 1, we're much more clearly, explicitly, semantically using, quote, unquote, "name" and, quote, unquote,
25:19
"house," because you index into lists and tuples using numbers, but you index into dictionaries using strings, as I've done here.
25:27
All right, let me go ahead and run Python of student.py. We'll again do Harry from Gryffindor.
25:33
And I think all is well. Let me run it one more time this time with Padma, who, in the movies,
25:38
is from Gryffindor, but should really be from Ravenclaw. Any questions then on this progression from tuples to lists to dictionaries?
25:49
We haven't necessarily introduced anything new, other than those tuples, which have been available to us all this time.
25:56
But the goal at the moment is just to demonstrate this distinction among these different data types and how they
26:02
each work a little bit differently. AUDIENCE: What if a combination of lists is there in our tuple?
26:10
We can change the list because are immutable but lists are mutable?
26:16
DAVID J. MALAN: Correct. You can change the contents of lists, and you can put most anything you want in them-- other lists or strings, as I've done,
26:23
integers, or anything else. Tuples you can do the exact same thing, but you cannot change them once you've created them.
26:29
A dictionary is more like a list in that it is mutable. You can change it.
26:34
But the way you index into a dictionary is by way of these keys, these strings, as we keep saying,
26:40
rather than by numbers-- those numeric indices. All right, well, let me propose that there is yet
