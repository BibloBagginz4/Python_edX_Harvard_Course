1:38:56
might have identified OOP by name in weeks past, we've all been using classes and objects for weeks now in this class.
1:39:05
In fact, if you think back on one of the very first things we did in this class, we used integers and just got integers from the user.
1:39:12
But if you haven't already-- if you go and dig into the documentation for integers,
1:39:17
which, again, lives at this URL here, you would actually find that int itself is and has been for weeks a class.
1:39:26
And in fact, this is the signature of the constructor call for an int, whereby you pass in x, like a number, quote, unquote, "50" or, quote,
1:39:35
unquote, something else-- you pass in optionally the base-- 10 for decimal, 2 for binary or anything else.
1:39:41
And that int function will actually return to you, all this time, an object of type int.
1:39:49
That is to say int is a class. It is a template, a blueprint for creating integers in memory.
1:39:55
And any time you and I have converted a string, for, instance to an int, you and I have been creating an object of type int that was calling,
1:40:03
apparently, the underscore underscore, init, underscore underscore method, that someone else-- the authors of Python--
1:40:09
wrote to give us back that proper integer. Besides that, if you can believe it, strs, strings in Python
1:40:16
have been classes since the first week of this class as well. If you look up the documentation for a str,
1:40:22
which lives at a similar URL there, you will find that, when you instantiate-- that is, create a str--
1:40:28
it takes, optionally, a parameter called object here, the default value of which is just, quote, unquote,
1:40:34
which allows you to create, in effect, an empty string, a blank string, if you will. But any time you and I have created strs or even used explicitly
1:40:42
the str function, you are getting back an object of type str. Any time you and I have forced a string to lowercase per the documentation,
1:40:52
using syntax like this, you and I have been taking an object of type str
1:40:58
and forcing it all to lowercase by calling a method called lower,
1:41:03
a method that the authors of Python built into the str class, but it's been there from the get-go, so this notion of methods is not
1:41:11
even new today. You wouldn't have been doing it for this long. If you've ever called strip to remove the leading and the trailing whitespace
1:41:17
from a string in Python, you are calling another method that came with Python-- written by the authors of Python.
1:41:23
And even though we didn't call it a class at the time, a str, all this time, has been a class.
1:41:29
And instances of strings are, themselves, objects. And those objects come therefore with these functions
1:41:36
built in-- a.k.a. methods that allow us to do things like force to lowercase and strip whitespace from the beginning and end.
1:41:42
Let's do another. list-- any time you've created a list, either syntactically with square
1:41:49
brackets or literally with L-I-S-T, open parentheses, closed parentheses, which is also possible, you have been using a class.
1:41:56
If you go to the documentation for list, at this similar URL here, or more specifically, the tutorial on lists here in Python,
1:42:04
you will see that a list is and has been, since the early weeks of this class, a class itself.
1:42:10
And that list class takes, as part of its initialization,
1:42:16
an optional iterable, something that can be iterated over-- like 1, 2, 3, or some list of values, and you can then get back
1:42:24
a list containing those same iterable values. If you've ever appended something to a list in this class,
1:42:30
as I have myself in the past, you've been using a method called append that comes with the list class that, per the x
1:42:37
here, takes an argument that allows you to append something to the current list, a.k.a.
1:42:42
Self in the context of that method. We can do this all day long. If you've used a dictionary or a dict in Python--
1:42:49
I've actually, all this time, been calling them dict objects, and that's for a reason. dict itself is a class in Python, if you pull up
1:42:57
its official documentation here. And you'll see that it is defined, indeed, as itself a class.
1:43:03
And that class comes with methods as well. And so any time we've manipulated dictionaries, we've been underneath the hood, using all of those same methods.
1:43:11
And in fact, we can see this if we're really curious. Let me go back over here to VS Code.
1:43:17
And let me go ahead and create a new file that, very simply, does something play around with data types.
1:43:22
And let me go ahead and create a new file, for instance, called, say, type.py, just so that I can poke around inside of some values.
1:43:30
And in type.py, I'm just going to go ahead and do this. I'm going to print out whatever the type is of, say, the number 50.
1:43:38
And This is a function you've not necessarily seen me use already, and it's not one you would frequently use in your own code.
1:43:44
There are other ways to detect, if you need to, what the type is of a variable. But in this case, type of 50 is just going to tell me and then print out
1:43:53
what the data type is of that value. Now, hopefully, all of us could guess that 50 is indeed going to be an integer--
1:43:59
that is, an int, but we can see it in this way. And this, too, is what's powerful about knowing a bit of programming.
1:44:04
If you want to know the answer to a question, just try it out, like I am here. So let me go ahead and run Python of type.py, Enter.
1:44:11
And there it is. When you print out the type of the number 50, you'll see on the screen,
1:44:17
in this cryptic syntax, class 'int.' This is not something that you probably want to show to the user.
1:44:23
But if you yourself just want to poke around and see what's going on or maybe use that information somehow, it's
1:44:29
certainly at your disposal to use this type function for that. Let's change it around a little bit.
1:44:34
Instead of passing as the argument to type 50, as an int, let's type something also familiar, like "hello, world,"
1:44:41
in double or single quotes. Let me go back to my terminal window, clear the screen, and run Python of type.py again.
1:44:47
And now, voila, there it is. All this time, a str is also a class.
1:44:52
We can do this a few more times, For. Instance. Let's go ahead and change "hello, world" to just an empty list--
1:44:58
open square bracket, closed square bracket. And this is starting to look a little cryptic, but, again, notice what I'm doing.
1:45:04
In square brackets is an empty list. We've done that before. That is the sole argument to this new type function.
1:45:11
And that's just being passed to the print function so that the return value of type is the argument to print.
1:45:18
So if I now run this code, Python of type.py, there it is. A list is a class, too.
1:45:24
You might recall that I said that you can also create an empty list by literally doing list ().
1:45:31
This is a bit of an inconsistency, as we can now identify that int and str and now list-- they're technically all lowercase.
1:45:39
And I went to great lengths of creating my student class to have that capital S. That's a convention.
1:45:46
Because int and stir and list and others come with Python, they decided to make their built-in data types-- even though they're classes--
1:45:55
all lowercase. But the convention, the recommendation in the Python community when creating your classes is to capitalize the first letter, as I did,
1:46:03
in something like Student, capital S. But list () is identical to really just
1:46:10
two empty square brackets. If I clear my screen and run type.py again, you see the exact same thing.
1:46:16
The class is called list. Let's do one more. Let me change the list to be not square brackets but curly braces.
1:46:23
We've done this before. Any time I've done two curly braces with nothing in between, this, of course, is an empty dictionary, or a dict object in Python.
1:46:31
Well, we can see that now. Let me clear my screen, run Python of type.py, Enter, and there it is-- class 'dict."
1:46:37
It's been there this whole time. We just didn't call it a class until today. I can similarly do this one explicitly.
1:46:44
Instead of two curly braces, let's write out dict with two parentheses. Now we have a lot of parentheses again, like with list.
1:46:51
But this is just making even more clear that the type of a dict object is indeed the class, dict, itself.
1:46:58
So this is to say that, as new as a lot of today's idea and syntax, might be you've actually been using it, perhaps unbeknownst to you,
1:47:05
for weeks now. We now just have terminology to describe what it is we've been doing all this time.
1:47:10
And you now have the expressiveness, with some practice, to create your own classes, inside of which are your own instance variables,
1:47:18
perhaps wrapped with those properties and your own instance methods. But it turns out there's other types of methods in the world.
